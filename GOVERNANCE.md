ACA-py Maintainers:

Please review the following [draft technical charter for ACA-py](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fNndB1G-P5KcKbpPROrVGWI7U5Yt7rf5vphssNokn9o/edit?tab=t.0)

Anywhere you would like to make a change, please add a comment **in the google doc linked above**.

Once the maintainers approve and are ok with all comments, LF Project Formation will finalize the document. Maintainers can then update GOVERNANCE.md with the PDF of the charter. 

Per the Linux Foundation, 

*A technical charter is created for all new projects to define both the project operations and the IP policy.  
We have proposed technical oversight for the project that falls to a “Technical Steering Committee” made up of the project’s committers. 
At a later date the TSC is free to evolve how membership on the TSC is determined to accommodate project growth and the evolution of its governance.*
